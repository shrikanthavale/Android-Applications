The deployment phase contains two stages, a three to six month pilot followed by a national deployment. At the conclusion of the pilot, the finished application is placed on a production server.
 
Users are trained, user guides are delivered, and the system is distributed nationally. After successful testing the product is delivered / deployed to the customer for their use.

In this phase, the system or system modifications are made operational in a production environment. The phase is initiated after the system has been tested and accepted by the user.

Activities in this phase include notification to end users, execution of previously defined training plan, data entry or conversion, and post deployment review.

Regardless of the type of system, all aspects of the deployment phase should be followed. This will ensure the smoothest possible transition to the organization’s desired goal.   

Activities involved in Deployment Phase are:
Use surveys to get user feedback
Conduct field studies to get info about actual use
Check objectives using usability testing.
